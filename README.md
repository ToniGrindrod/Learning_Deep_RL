# Learning_Deep_RL

This repository contains code, notebooks, and examples for learning and experimenting with **Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)** algorithms. The goal is to provide hands-on implementations and educational material to understand and test various RL methods.

## Overview

Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) combines reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, allowing agents to learn policies or value functions in high-dimensional state spaces. This repository is an exploratory and educational resource with working examples (and notebooks) for core Deep RL algorithms applied to popular benchmark environments.

## Contents

Some of the key files and notebooks include:

- `DQN.ipynb` — Deep Q-Network implementation  
- `DQN_minatar.ipynb` — DQN applied to MinAtar environments  
- `REINFORCE.ipynb`, `REINFORCE_minatar.ipynb` — Policy gradient (REINFORCE) examples  
- `PPONotebook.py`, `PPONotebook_Lunar.py`, `PPONotebook_minatar.py` — Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) variants  
- `.neptune/async` — possibly logging / experiment-tracking setup  
- `SMAC/` — (likely) StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge related experiments  
- `.DS_Store` — macOS hidden folder file (can be removed from version control)

## Dependencies & Setup

To run the notebooks and scripts, you’ll want a Python environment with RL and deep learning support. Below is an example list of dependencies; you may want to pin exact versions.

### Recommended dependencies

- Python 3.7+  
- `numpy`  
- `gym` or `gymnasium`  
- `torch` (PyTorch)  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualization)  
- (Optional) `neptune-client` or other logging/tracking tools  
- (Optional) `minatar` environments or wrappers if using MinAtar  
- (Optional) RL environment wrappers / utilities (e.g. `stable-baselines3`, etc.)

You can set up a virtual environment and install:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy gym torch matplotlib seaborn
# plus any other tools required (neptune, minatar, etc.)
